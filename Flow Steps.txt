Given : Posenet model js, Posenet Keypoints(17)

Steps:
1)use keypoints to access x and y coordinates of 3 parts between 2 joint
example :

shoulder=[LEFT_SHOULDER.value.x,LEFT_SHOULDER.value.y]
elbow   = [LEFT_ELBOW.value.x,LEFT_ELBOW.value.y]
wrist   = [LEFT_WRIST.value.x,LEFT_WRIST.value.y]

2) using x and y cordinates from above such examples, we calucate angle at elbow(example) by defining a function.
3) based on the angle calculated and its range we perform operations.
